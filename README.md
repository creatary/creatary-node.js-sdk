### Initialization

Init Creatary module with your application consumer key and secret (also called client_id and client_secret: (that you obtain from https://creatary.com)

```js
var creatary = require('creatary-sdk').init(consumer_key, consumer_secret, [optional_parameters]);
```

```js
optional_parameters = {
    server: srv, // (optional) Pass your Express instance, Creatary module will reuse it for OAuth and listening for SMS
    receiveSms : { // (optional) Parameters for receiving SMS
        url: 'http://localhost/sms', // (mandatory) SMS callback url
        callBack: onSms // (mandatory) Callback function for incoming SMS
    },
    oAuth : { // (optional if you use OAuth 1.0 mode) Do NOT supply otherwise
        connectUrl : '/connect', // (mandatory) Relative URL, used to initiate the OAuth authorization for your app
        url: 'http://localhost/callback', // (mandatory) Absolute URL, used redirect back the user after authorization
        callback: onAuthed // (mandatory) Callback function after successful oAuth flow
    },
    oAuth2 : true // (mandatory if you use OAuth 2.0 mode) Do NOT supply otherwise
}

// Send SMS
creatary.Sms.send(toToken, "Hello World SMS");
// Receive SMS
creatary.Sms.receive(function(data), [params]);

data = {
    to: destination MSISDN
    body: messages
    access_token: token which identifies the sender, it can be used for response
    transaction_id: transaction id of the SMS, use it in order to keep the SMS session
}

params = {
    url: "http://localhost:80/sms" // it's used to open the server port and bind the path
}
```

### Location

```js
// Query Location
creatary.Location.getCoordinates(userToken, function(locData));

locData = {
    latitude:
    longitude: 
    accuracy: 
    timestamp:
}
